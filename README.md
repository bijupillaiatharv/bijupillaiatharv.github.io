### Argo
**Specificiations:**
  * Category: Bipropellant Launch Vehicle (IPA/N2O)
  * Goal Altitude: 100,000 ft
  * Thrust: 1750 lbf
  * Size: 8 in OD, 22+ ft long

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * Designed pressure vessels to hold fuel and oxidizer
    * sized radial bolts to ensure tank can withstand internal pressure and external thrust loads
    * created python script that models the blowdown of the fuel tank to approximate necessary ullage volume
    * ran finite element analysis on tank domes to verify design
  * Intertank Fluids Lead
    * ensure proper routing, valve selection and sizing of intertank fluids components
    * responsible for designing fuel/ox press, dump, and relief systems on vehicle
    * guide team members through the design, build, test process for this subsystem

### Icarus
**Specifications:**
  * Altitude: 13,000 ft
  * Thrust: 2200 lbf
  * Type: Bipropellant (IPA/N2O)
  * Size: 8in OD, 17 ft long

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * designed 3D printed wire cover to secure avionics downcomer wire and improve aerodynamics
    * ensured 3D printed fixtures interfaced with intertank, thrust structure, and avionics bay
  * supported flight readiness test campaign through test infrastructure setup
  * designed avionics D-subminiature covers to protect wire harnessing

### VEGAS
**Specifications:**
  * Category: Bipropellant Test Stand (IPA/N2O)
  * Max Thrust Supported: 600 lbf
  * Use Cases: Rapid deployment and testing of small-scale rocket elements, utilize test data for full size designs

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * designed fuel-centered carbon steel pintle injector
  * sized pintle holes and annular sleeve to ensure proper mass flow rates of fuel and oxidizer
  * ran fluid simulations to ensure injector stiffness is suffcient
  * coordinated with other subteams to accomodate interfacing methods

### Hybrid Intro Project
**Specifications:**
  * Category: Hybrid Rocket Nozzle + Accompanying Flight Computer (Paraffin Wax/GOx)
  * Thrust: 10 lbf
  * Use Cases: allows incoming members of the team to acclimate themselves with the engineering design process and fundamental rocketry concepts

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * Co-led the an introductory project where I helped guide new members in sizing and printing a hybrid rocket nozzle
  * Held office hours to solidify basic rocketry concepts from Rocket Propulsion Elements (Sutton & Bilbarz)
  * Led three sets of design reviews to provide feedback for their design
    * corrected mistakes made in nozzle sizing calculations
    * critique FEA analyses and engineering drawings
    * provided feedback on design review best practices
