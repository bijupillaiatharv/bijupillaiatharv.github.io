## Coursework
### ME460/461: Senior Capstone Project
**Overview:**
  * Design domestic aircraft using hybrid electric turboprop system
  * Research the fidelity of a hybrid electric propulsion system provide a firm rationale as to its applicability in the current aircraft market
  * Capitalize on 50-seat airliner market share, fuel economy of 500 nmi/seat range
  * Primary objectives are to create an aircraft that balances fuel efficiency and technological advancement and its ability to produce revenue

### ME408: Aircraft Performance and Design
**Overview:**
  * Design twin-jet continental airliner to compete with current Airbus 320 and Boeing 737 designs
  * Prioritize long-range commercial transport (~3000 nmi) through maximizing fuel efficiency and materials research
  * Modify cabin design to better accomodate passengers and improve comfort
  * Aim to create design that is 5-10% more profitable to capture market share
