### Argo
**Specificiations:**
  * Category: Bipropellant Launch Vehicle (IPA/N2O)
  * Goal Altitude: 100,000 ft
  * Thrust: 1750 lbf
  * Size: 8 in OD, 22+ ft long

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * Designed pressure vessels to hold fuel and oxidizer
    * sized radial bolts to ensure tank can withstand internal pressure and external thrust loads
    * created python script that models the blowdown of the fuel tank to approximate necessary ullage volume
    * ran finite element analysis on tank domes to verify design
  * Intertank Fluids Lead
    * ensure proper routing, valve selection and sizing of intertank fluids components
    * responsible for designing fuel/ox press, dump, and relief systems on vehicle
    * guide team members through the design, build, test process for this subsystem

### Icarus
**Specifications:**
  * Altitude: 13,000 ft
  * Thrust: 2200 lbf

  * Size: 8in OD, 17 ft long

**Contributions/Responsibilities:**
  * designed 3D printed wire cover to secure avionics downcomer wire and improve aerodynamics
    * ensured 3D printed fixtures interfaced with intertank, thrust structure, and avionics bay
  * supported flight readiness test campaign through test infrastructure setup
  * designed avionics D-subminiature covers to protect wire harnessing

### VEGAS
**Specifications:**
  * Category: Bipropellant Test Stand (IPA/N2O)
  * Max Thrust Supported: 600 lbf
  * Use Cases: Rapid deployment and testing of small-scale rocket elements, utilize test data for full size designs
